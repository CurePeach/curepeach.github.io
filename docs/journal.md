# Design Journal

**1st July 2020**

- I originally wanted to use Vue but I will try using React since I am quite familiar with Vue already.
- Need to figure out how to host with Github pages without using one of their pre-determined themes.

**11th August 2020**
- I want to implement my Ferris Wheel website idea so I'm going to implement a simplified version using tabs and folders instead.
- I have decided to code my first draft of my website using pure HTML, JavaScript and CSS. I have never coded a website from the ground up before so I will try this first to learn more about the origin of websites? I don't know - it just sort of seemed fun.
- I'm really bad with flex stuff I found as working through university projects. I created something really simple using the flex property by creating two sides of the website. The left bar will contain important information and the main will contain more in-depth information based on certain categories. The next step is to make the left bar static on the page and so, only the main will change as the user scrolls.

- Added background colours. My favourite colours are blue and yellow so I've decided to go for a teal colour scheme. I find teal to be always aesthetically pleasing.
- Changed the font family to monospace because I thought it looked cute. No other reason. Don't think I need another reason.
- Added a JavaScript script to make sure I know what I'm doing. I realised I have to add the script AFTER everything has been rendered or I can't do anything. Even though it looks like things are working at the same time... they're not.

- I noticed when the window was minimised, the links look a bit weird so I'm changing the titles to FontAwesome icons. Learning to set these up is taking a bit longer than I first assumed because I remember in one of my projects last year, my friend wanted to add a play button and I think that's already built-in so we didn't need to use FontAwesome.
- I just added some dummy blocks of data to test out what my page would look like if it had information on it. I want to make it that the side bar is always there but I'm not sure how to. Time to do some extensive googling!! I still can't seem to figure it out without ruining the rest of my page so I guess it will have to do.
- My initial goal of this coding session was to make the subtitles interactive. It required a little bit of JavaScript revision but I think I got it done pretty well! :)

- Goal for this session is to just replace the lorem ipsum filler text with actual information about me.
- Found a bug where the font size of the left bar is extremely small on different sized windows. I'm not sure why it is doing this because I don't have a line that explicitly impacts the CSS around font size. I'm not going to be surprised if it's something to with flex because flex things make me sad honestly.
- Replacing the filler text is taking a lot longer than I estimated. I have completed Work Experience and Skills. I think I can complete the other three categories on another day.
- Also, note I want to add a little animation on the website. I will research how to accomplish this in the meantime.

**18th January 2021**
- I want to add a volunteering section because there are things that don't really fall into any of the categories that I want to mention.
