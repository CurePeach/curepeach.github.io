# Design Journal

**1st July 2020**

- I originally wanted to use Vue but I will try using React since I am quite familiar with Vue already.
- Need to figure out how to host with Github pages without using one of their pre-determined themes.

**11th August 2020**
- I want to implement my Ferris Wheel website idea so I'm going to implement a simplified version using tabs and folders instead.
- I have decided to code my first draft of my website using pure HTML, JavaScript and CSS. I have never coded a website from the ground up before so I will try this first to learn more about the origin of websites? I don't know - it just sort of seemed fun.
