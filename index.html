          <b>Hard Skills</b>
          <ul>
            <li>C (programming language): This is the first programming language I was comfortable in and is the language I teach at UNSW.</li>
            <li>Python: I have completed many courses requiring substantial knowledge of this language including COMP1531 and COMP3311.</li>
            <li>Javascript: I have completed courses and projects using this language including COMP2041 and a music application.</li>
            <li>Linux: I use the Linux interface regularly and am very familiar with it.</li>
            <li>Git: I use Git regularly to keep track of university assignments and projects I am undertaking.</li>
            <li>UML diagrams: I have used UML diagrams many times to describe software. I have used them to showcase the sequence of events and to describe the classes within the software.</li>
            <li>PostgreSQL: I have studied this language at university through various assignments and now, can create schemas and navigate the database through queries and functions (SQL and PLpgSQL).</li>
            <li>Database modelling using ER and relational diagrams: I am comfortable in reading and drawing these diagrams as well as translating these into schemas in SQL.</li>
            <li>Java: I have undertaken COMP2511 at UNSW and have created Java applications from scratch and from prepared code.</li>
            <li>Perl: I have a good knowledge of this language after studying it at university.</li>
          </ul>

          <b>Soft Skills</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Agile: Whenever I am working in groups at university, I promote agile practices including standups (synchronous and asynchronous), and using online taskboards including Trello, Github and Gitlab's taskboards.</li>
            <li>Communication: I am always willing to speak and communicate what I am doing. If someone is confused or struggling to understand, I take the initiative to describe my thoughts from a different perspective.</li>
            <li>Teamwork: I will always try to help my teammates whenever they are encountering problems. I aim to split the tasks required evenly.</li>
            <li>Time management: I always start on assignments and projects with much time before the due date. If it is a frequent task, I like to assign a specific day of the week to the task.</li>
            <li>Leadership: I have taken leadership roles before and am comfortable in organising meetings and collating work.</li>
